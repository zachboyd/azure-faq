Websites have ARR installed, but proxies are disabled. Turns out it can be done with through the use of site extensions. Information about site extensions can be found at\r\nhttps://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Site-Extensions.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this you need to place an applicationHost.xdt file directly under the site directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/site\r\n    applicationHost.xdt\r\n    /wwwroot\r\n/LogFiles\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can do this using Kudu. Information on accessing Kudu can be found at https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-the-kudu-service\r\n\r\nInside of the applicationHost.xdt we need to modify the servers applicationHost.config to enable proxies. To do this we can use the following code below.\r\n\r\n*applicationHost.xdt*\r\n```\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?> \r\n<configuration xmlns:xdt=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform\"> \r\n    <system.webServer> \r\n            <proxy enabled=\"true\"  xdt:Transform=\"Insert\"  />\r\n    </system.webServer> \r\n</configuration> \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimply restart your website after adding the applicationHost.xdt file with the code above. This will enable the use of reverse proxies for your website. Now you can configure web.config or use IIS Manager to remotely manage your website, http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2014/02/28/remote-administration-of-windows-azure-websites-using-iis-manager.aspx\r\n\r\nHope this helps anyone else who has the same requirements.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
